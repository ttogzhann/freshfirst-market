# FreshFirst Market

Create a FreshFirst application.

follow the spec

Centralize every backend call in one services layer,

and create a mock implementation of it so the

whole app runs without a real backend.

Add tests.

This project was built with [Lovable](https://lovable.dev).

## Development

Prefer working locally? You need Node.js and npm — [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

```sh
git clone <this-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>/frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The frontend application and its configuration live in `frontend/`. Run all npm commands from that directory.

```sh
npm run build
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run validate:api
```

`backend/` is reserved for the backend. Project instructions and specifications remain in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/` at the repository root.

The npm workflow uses the tracked `frontend/package-lock.json`; `npm ci` installs its exact dependency tree. The old Bun lockfile has been removed to avoid competing dependency resolutions.

The frontend uses a centralized `FreshService` mock with browser localStorage persistence. `/basket` manages servings, confirmed substitutions and cooking; `/shopping` generates combined requirements, preserves manual lines, confirms overwriting edits and transfers confirmed purchases exactly once. Removing generated lines also requires confirmation on regeneration. Different pantry expiry dates require editing the existing entry before merging.

Root `openapi.yaml` defines 23 unauthenticated operations, request/response schemas, validation and conflict errors. `npm run validate:api` validates the OpenAPI document and checks one-to-one operation coverage against the typed service. A future HTTP adapter must map the documented error envelope to `ServiceError`.

Backend-phase requirements remain intentionally unimplemented: live TheMealDB import (the mock imports bundled fixtures), the HTTP adapter and server, transactional database persistence, and backend/restart acceptance tests. No backend or database code is included in this preparation. The current recipe fixtures and substitution rules are mock data; production normalization and context review remain necessary when implementing the importer.
